            <h3>What's all this, then?</h3>
            <p>Python 2.7, and by extension the entire Python 2 family, <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0373/">will not be maintained past 2020</a>. Since no official date has been given, this clock counts down until April 12th, 2020, which will be roughly the time of the 2020 PyCon. No one has said that PyCon 2020 will be the official death-date, but it seems like a good idea. Maybe we'll have a wake, and a party. In any case, the time to update to Python 3 is now, and there are <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/howto/pyporting.html">lots of resources</a> to help.</p>
            <p>Python 2, thank you for your years of faithful service.</p>
            <p>Python 3, your time is now. </p>
